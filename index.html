            This is a github profile finder application , using which one can
            fetch some important data of their github account .<br />The only
            prerequisite is that you must know the username of the person, who's
            github account details you want to find. Also that use of Github API
            is done , to fetch the data from github database. <br /><br />

            Basically , talking about APIs , abbreviated form for Application
            Program Interface , it is a construct that is built in inside the
            browser , that helps us to fetch the desired data from the database
            server . API's provides interface between the user and the database
            server . They also act as a security layer between user and the
            server .
